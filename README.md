# checkhosts
Check hosts for Adobe nerds.

Basically, just a host checker checking your hosts file and comparing it to the CCStopper one. Use this everytime you suspect the hosts updated.
To use it? Download from releases and run with administrator, you can also directly download from the source, or the post I did on r/GenP (https://www.reddit.com/r/GenP/comments/16ues7x/a_simple_way_to_check_your_hosts_standalone/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
